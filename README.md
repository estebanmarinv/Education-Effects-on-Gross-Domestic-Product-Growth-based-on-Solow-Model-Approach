# Education-Effects-on-Gross-Domestic-Product-Growth-based-on-Solow-Model-Approach
Research

In this project we estimate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of countries explained by education
variables and controlling by the Solow Model variables, on the so called human capital approach. Firstly, we
mention our motivation and importance of economist Robert Lucas on the literature. Secondly, with World
Bank data from more than 200 countries in a 30 years span, we test some models to see the significance
of the education variables. Thirdly, we try to improve our model by clustering out data set and just use
OECD countries to explain the relation between education and GDP growth. Fourthly, we run some granger
causality tests among the variables to proof if there is any causation on them. Finally, we estimate some
model for specific countries to show the differences that exist on the variables within nations. Our analysis
concludes with a small summary of our work and comments on future possible extensions on this project
